                <h2>My failures of previous year</h2>
                <p>Success is good but failure is better. You must not let successes get to your head but also must not
                    let failure consume your heart. Know that, sometimes, actually most times, things don't go as
                    planned and that is perfectly fine. For many young people, it's easy to simply give up when things
                    don't work out.</p>
